A guide to creating expanding forms in Gambas<br>Written in Gambas 3.8.4<br>Basic knowledge of Gambas is expected
The first thing to do is create a new Graphical Project in Gambas and have the FMain form ready to work on
Set the Form's <b>Arrangement</b> property to <b>Vertical</b>. This will force all the Form's objects to the top of the form.<br>Add a <b>HBox</b> (from the 'Container' tab) at the bottom of the Form, this needs to be 28 high, its width is unimportant.<br>Add a <b>Button</b> in the <b>Hbox</b>, put it on the right, make its height 21 or less, give the <b>Button</b> a name e.g. '&Button1'.<br>The <b>Button</b> will be forced to the left by the <b>HBox</b>. In a <b>HBox</b> everything is pushed to the left but will expand vertically.<br>Add a <b>TextArea</b> above the <b>HBox</b> but near the bottom of the Form about 100 high, again the width is unimportant 
Now run the program, and notice that both <b>TextArea</b> and the <b>HBox</b> have been pushed to the top of the Form. The <b>TextArea</b> has expanded horizontally as has the <b>HBox</b> but you can't see that. The <b>Button</b> has been pushed to the left of the <b>HBox</b>. Notice the <b>Button</b> has expanded vertically in the <b>HBox</b>. Expand the form so you can see the results. Notice how the <b>TextArea</b> extends to the very edge of the form 
Stop your program and add a <b>Panel</b> (the size is unimportant) in the <b>HBox</b> on the left of the <b>Button</b> and change its property <b>Expand</b> to <b>True</b>. Notice the stripes that indicate that it will expand horizontally pushing the <b>Button</b> to the right. Change the <b>TextArea</b> property <b>Expand</b> to <b>True</b>, this will allow the <b>TextArea</b> to fill as much of the Form it can. Change the Form's property <b>Padding</b> to <b>5</b>, this will give the form a border 
Run your program and notice that the <b>Button</b> has now been pushed to the right. The Form has a border due to the <b>Padding</b>, experiment with the <b>Padding</b> value to see the effect. The <b>TextArea</b> has expanded to fill the form pushing the <b>HBox</b>, with it's <b>Button</b> to the bottom. Expand the Form to see the results
Stop your program and in the <b>HBox</b> add 2 more <b>Buttons</b> and add another <b>Panel</b> with the property <b>Expand</b> set to <b>True</b>. Run your program and expand the form, you will see that this keeps the middle <b>Button</b> in the middle and the others to the outer edges whatever size you make the Form
Try adding a <b>HBox</b> above everything else, add some <b>ToolButtons</b> (add Pictures or you wont see them) spaced with <b>Panels</b>. Make the last <b>Panel</b> expand and run your program. Notice how the <b>ToolButtons</b> are pushed to the left except the last <b>ToolButton</b> which has been pushed to the right by the expanding <b>Panel</b> 
If you wanted to add something to the left of the <b>TextArea</b>, another <b>TextArea</b> for example, this will not work. Try running this and you will see that as the form's <b>Arrangement</b> is set to <b>Vertical</b> the new <b>TextArea</b> is forced under the first <b>TextArea</b>. Try it and see what happens
We need to put these 2 items in a <b>HBox</b> so they will behave like the <b>Buttons</b> and <b>ToolButtons</b>. You could add a <b>HBox</b> and put the items in but there is another way. Holding the [Ctrl] key down select both <b>TextAreas</b>, right click and select <b>Edit>Embed into a container</b>. Select the newly created container, right click and select <b>Change into>HBox</b>. Set the new <b>HBox</b> property <b>Expand</b> to <b>True</b>. Run your program, try changing the <b>Expand</b> properties of your new <b>TextArea</b> and rerun
Add a <b>Panel</b> between the <b>TextAreas</b> about 7 wide. Make sure both <b>TextAreas</b> and their <b>HBox</b> have their properties <b>Expand</b> set to <b>True</b> and run your program, you should see something similar to the image below.<p>I hope this short explanation has helped get you started. There is a fair amount more to learn but if you have grasped the concepts here you are in a position to try out the various other options available to you.
